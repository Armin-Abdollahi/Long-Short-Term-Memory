Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

What is LSTM?
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture widely used in Deep Learning. It excels at capturing long-term dependencies, making it ideal for sequence prediction tasks.

Unlike traditional neural networks, LSTM incorporates feedback connections, allowing it to process entire sequences of data, not just individual data points. This makes it highly effective in understanding and predicting patterns in sequential data like time series, text, and speech.

LSTM has become a powerful tool in artificial intelligence and deep learning, enabling breakthroughs in various fields by uncovering valuable insights from sequential data.
